> In this section, you will get SQL Server 2017 running on RedHat Enterprise Linux. After that you will install the necessary dependencies to run .NET Core.

## Step 1.1 Install SQL Server
{% include partials/install_sql_server_linux_rhel.md %}

## Step 1.2 Install .NET Core on RHEL 7.2

If you already have .NET Core installed on your machine, skip this step. Install .NET Core using the following commands.

You also need to ensure that your system supports enabling software collections via the [scl tool](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/1/html-single/Software_Collections_Guide/#sect-Enabling_the_Software_Collection).

1. Enable the .NET Core Channel. 
For help registering your machine to get access to the channel see [Chapter 1 of the .NET Core Getting Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/net-core/1.0/getting-started-guide/chapter-1-install-net-core-100-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux).
```terminal
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-dotnet-rpms
```
2. Install scl-tools
```terminal
yum install scl-utils
```
3. Install .NET Core
```terminal
yum install rh-dotnetcore11
```
4. Enable the .NET Core software collection
```terminal
scl enable rh-dotnetcore11 bash
```
> You have successfully installed .NET Core on your RHEL machine. You now have everything you need to start writing your C# apps with SQL Server!
